# World Cup Bets - Christo kai Julian (pronounced "chai")

## About this page

The world cup betting system is a small side project that was developed for Julian and Christos (while that m******a still worked with Julian... -.-), where the could be doing different kinds of bets for the games of the world cup. It was a fun project, from the 14th of June until the 19th of July.  
You can view the results here: [hint... Julian won ;)](/calculate)

## How To Use

Please follow the next steps:

1.  Sign up [here.](/sign) or log in if your're already a file mou.
2.  Enter your bet.
3.  Press Submit.
4.  Enjoy the game!
5.  Optionally, view your and your team-mates bet on profile

## How It's Made

This site is run on MEEN Stack, as in MEAN without the A. It's hosted on glitch and the database lives on M-Lab. It uses EJS to render the pages and [worldcup.sfg.io](worlcup.sfg.io). It was made with love by Julian, and often forgotten by Christo.... Yeah... I had to enter his bets manually sometimes... * cough*

## Please Note

This was just a fun little project, nothing too serious. You can find the quite ugly, definitely not clean code on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/~world-cup-bets) or Github (once I have time to clean it)
